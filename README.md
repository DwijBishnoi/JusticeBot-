# JusticeBot

We created a driven Bot responsible for assisting in legal procedures.
we created this JusticeBot as we were given a problem statement for SIH 2024.
We made this Bot to Provide all necessary help or legal help and access to all legal procedures including information like the Women's Safety Act, Kidnapping Act, and CourtFees Act, etc.
We also provide datasets regarding all necessary data points and legal help. 
This Bot can also provide a Court Fees Structure for Proceedings related to miscellaneous acts.
This Bot also has a Multilingual structure which helps local people interact with the Bot in their convenience and with their language.
